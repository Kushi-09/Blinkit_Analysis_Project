## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze Blinkit’s retail sales data to:

* Evaluate overall sales performance and revenue trends
* Understand the impact of **fat content** on product sales
* Identify high-performing **item categories**
* Analyze outlet performance by **size, type, location, and establishment year**
* Assess customer satisfaction using ratings
* Support data-driven decisions for inventory, pricing, and expansion strategies

## 🧠 Business Problem

Blinkit operates across multiple outlet types and locations with a wide variety of grocery items. Business stakeholders often face challenges in answering questions such as:

* Does **fat content** (Low Fat vs Regular) influence total sales?
* Which **item types** generate the highest revenue?
* How do **outlet size and location** impact sales performance?
* Are newer or older outlets performing better?
* How do customer ratings correlate with sales?

Raw transactional data makes it difficult to extract these insights without a centralized analytical view.
This dashboard converts complex data into **clear, actionable business insights**.
